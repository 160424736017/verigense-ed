# Routing Implementation

This document describes the routing structure that has been implemented for the Verigense Education Platform.

## Implemented Routes

### Global Routes
- `/` - Redirects to student dashboard
- `/login` - Login page (placeholder)
- `/logout` - Logout page (placeholder)
- `/search` - Global search page

- `/help` - Help center page
- `/unauthorized` - Access denied page

### Student Routes
- `/student/dashboard` - Student dashboard
- `/student/assignments` - Student assignments
- `/student/grades` - Student grades
- `/student/notices` - Student notices
- `/student/payments` - Student payments
- `/student/study-materials` - Student study materials

### Teacher Routes
- `/teacher/dashboard` - Teacher dashboard
- `/teacher/classes` - Teacher classes overview
- `/teacher/classes/[classId]` - Specific class details
- `/teacher/classes/[classId]/attendance` - Class attendance
- `/teacher/classes/[classId]/grades` - Class grades
- `/teacher/classes/[classId]/assignments` - Class assignments
- `/teacher/classes/[classId]/materials` - Class materials
- `/teacher/classes/[classId]/students` - Class students
- `/teacher/substitutions` - Substitutions management
- `/teacher/notices` - Teacher notices
- `/teacher/analytics` - Teacher analytics
- `/teacher/messages` - Teacher messages

### Admin Routes
- `/admin/dashboard` - Admin dashboard
- `/admin/students` - Students management
- `/admin/students/add` - Add new student
- `/admin/students/[studentId]` - Specific student details
- `/admin/teachers` - Teachers management
- `/admin/teachers/add` - Add new teacher
- `/admin/teachers/[teacherId]` - Specific teacher details
- `/admin/classes` - Classes management
- `/admin/classes/add` - Add new class
- `/admin/classes/[classId]` - Specific class details
- `/admin/timetables` - Timetables management
- `/admin/exams` - Exams management
- `/admin/fees` - Fees management
- `/admin/notices` - Notices management

### API Routes
- `/api/v1/student/*` - Student API endpoints
- `/api/v1/teacher/*` - Teacher API endpoints
- `/api/v1/admin/*` - Admin API endpoints
- `/api/v1/parent/*` - Parent API endpoints

## Security Implementation

### Middleware
A middleware function has been implemented to handle role-based access control:
- Protects admin routes for non-admin users
- Protects teacher routes for non-teacher users
- Supports multi-role switching (same account can act as different roles)

### Route Protection
- Role guards are implemented in middleware
- Unauthorized access redirects to `/unauthorized` page
- Audit logging for admin actions (to be implemented)

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Routes to Implement
- Parent routes
- Alumni routes
- Examiner routes
- Library routes

### Enhanced Security Features
- More granular role permissions
- Session management
- JWT token validation
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

### Shortcut Routes
- `/student/attendance/today`
- `/student/fees/pay`
- `/teacher/attendance/today`
- `/teacher/grades/pending`
- `/admin/documents/generate/tc/:studentId`
- `/admin/reports/daily`

## File Structure
The routing follows Next.js App Router conventions with:
- Directory-based routing
- Dynamic routes using bracket notation `[param]`
- Route groups for organizing layouts
- API routes in the `app/api` directory
