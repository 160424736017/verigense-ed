# Role-Based Navigation Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Middleware Configuration**: Updated the middleware matcher to properly handle all routes including API routes
2. **Role Validation**: Added strict validation to ensure only valid roles ('student', 'teacher', 'admin') are used
3. **Cookie Management**: Improved cookie handling to ensure proper role persistence during navigation
4. **Process Conflicts**: Killed conflicting processes that were preventing the server from running on the correct port
5. **Cache Control**: Added cache control headers to prevent browser caching during development
6. **Component Validation**: Enhanced role validation in all components to ensure proper role handling

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)
- Enhanced role determination logic with proper validation
- Added strict role enforcement for each role-specific area
- Improved cookie management with proper setting and clearing
- Added cache control headers to prevent caching during development
- Updated matcher configuration to handle all routes properly

### 2. App Sidebar (`src/components/app-sidebar.tsx`)
- Ensured fresh navigation items on every render by removing useMemo
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging role changes
- Verified proper role-based navigation items display

### 3. Role Provider (`src/components/role-provider.tsx`)
- Added strict role validation
- Enhanced debugging logs
- Ensured proper role propagation to child components

### 4. Root Layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Added role validation to ensure only valid roles are used
- Enhanced debugging capabilities
- Ensured proper role context throughout the application

## Testing

Created comprehensive test pages and API routes to verify:
- Role switching functionality
- Proper navigation item display for each role
- Cookie persistence during navigation
- Unauthorized access prevention

## Verification

The role-based navigation system is now working correctly:
- Students see only student-specific navigation items
- Teachers see only teacher-specific navigation items
- Role switching works properly via URL parameters
- Unauthorized access to role-specific areas is properly blocked
- Role persistence works through cookie management
